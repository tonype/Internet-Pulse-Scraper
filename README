Simple Python script that scrapes all the latencies on internetpulse.com.

You can filter them based on the different types of latencies (normal, warning, critical), as well as view all of them at once.

Ideas for features to add include showing network availability and packet loss. Also, choose whether to view latencies over the last hour, four hours, or twenty-four hours.
